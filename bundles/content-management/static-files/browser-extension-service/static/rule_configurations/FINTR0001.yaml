      - Typical Formats:
          - Source Code: Python, C++, or other programming languages used to implement trading algorithms.
          - Model Documentation: Detailed descriptions of algorithmic models, including mathematical formulas, optimization parameters, and testing methodologies.
          - Backtesting Data: Historical market data and performance results used to validate the algorithm's effectiveness, often in XLSX, CSV, or proprietary formats.
      - Variations: May include annotated code, flowcharts, or integrated components within trading platforms.
      - Exclusions: Publicly disclosed algorithms or generic models published in academic papers should not be classified as sensitive.
      - Contextual Clues: Found in documents labeled "Algorithm Design", "Model Development", "Proprietary Trading Model", or "Backtesting Results".
      - False Positive Examples: General algorithm templates, publicly available code, or non-proprietary research papers.
    
    2. Market Data Analytics and Insights:
      - Typical Formats:
          - Market Data Feeds: High-resolution real-time or historical data feeds, including tick-by-tick price movements, order book data, and trade volumes.

          - Proprietary Indices Methodology: Detailed methodology for constructing and maintaining proprietary indices.
      - Variations: Includes raw data sets, processed analytics, and predictive models.
      - Exclusions: Aggregated, anonymized data available through public market reports should not be classified as sensitive.
      - Contextual Clues: Found in documents labeled "Confidential Market Data", "Proprietary Analysis", or "Research Data Feed".
      - False Positive Examples: Public market summaries or analytics that do not reveal proprietary insights.
    
    3. New Financial Product Development:
      - Typical Formats:
          - Product Design Documents: Specifications, implementation plans, and testing results for new financial products, such as options, futures, or indices.

      - Variations: May include internal white papers, development timelines, and strategic market entry plans.
      - Exclusions: Publicly announced or launched products, or general market analysis that does not contain proprietary details.
      - Contextual Clues: Often found in sections labeled "Product Development", "Prototype Testing", or "Regulatory Filing".
      - False Positive Examples: Publicly disclosed product summaries or regulatory filings without sensitive details.
    
    Supplementary Data:
    
    1. Confidential Communications:
      - Formats:
          - Internal Emails and Memos: Communications discussing research progress, strategic decisions, and confidential updates on new products or trading algorithms.
          - Meeting Minutes: Records of meetings that discuss sensitive research projects, proprietary methodologies, or strategic initiatives.
      - Variations: Can include both formal and informal communications, often in email or document format.
      - Exclusions: General internal updates or communications not containing proprietary information should not be classified as sensitive.
      - Contextual Clues: Often labeled as "Confidential Communication", "Internal Memo", or "Meeting Minutes".
      - False Positive Examples: Routine internal communications that lack specific sensitive content.
    
    2. Strategic Research Documents:
      - Formats:
          - Research Proposals: Detailed documents outlining the objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes of research projects related to new financial products or market analytics.
          - Project Plans: Comprehensive plans for developing and launching new products, including timelines, resource allocations, and risk assessments.

      - Variations: Includes drafts, presentations, and peer review notes.
      - Exclusions: Publicly available research summaries or conference presentations should not be classified as sensitive.
      - Contextual Clues: Often found in documents labeled "Research Proposal", "Project Plan", or "Internal White Paper".
      - False Positive Examples: General research discussions or summaries that do not contain proprietary information.
    
    3. Regulatory and Compliance Research:
      - Formats:
          - Draft Filings and Compliance Reviews: Documents prepared for submission to regulatory bodies, including draft filings and internal compliance assessments.
