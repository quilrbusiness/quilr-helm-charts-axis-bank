    Description:
    Regulatory and Compliance Data refers to documents, communications, and records that are created or maintained to ensure that an organization complies with financial regulations and industry standards. This includes regulatory filings with bodies like the SEC, internal audit reports, risk assessments, and related communications. This data is highly sensitive as it often contains detailed information about a company's operations, financial performance, and compliance status.

       - Variations: Filings may include attachments, exhibits, or amendments.
       - Exclusions: Publicly available filings that have already been disclosed to the public should not be classified as sensitive unless they include confidential sections.
       - Contextual Clues: Often found in documents labeled "SEC Filing", "Regulatory Disclosure", or "Annual Report".

       - Exclusions: Hypothetical scenarios or generic risk management frameworks not tied to specific assessments should not be classified as sensitive.
